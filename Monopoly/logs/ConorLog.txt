    THE SHIT HAS COLORS
    
    The numbers are now color coated. Found some issues in board, fixed what I could. Gotta work on a lot of testing tomorrow. When a player lands on "go to jail" they act like they are in jail but don't get moved to the right square.

    GUI is very close!
    
    Only thing needed is to print out what properties the player has at the start of each postTurn. This was semi-implemented in Trade by Dan, so thanks.
    
    Players can move around but the amount of buttons is annoying AF

    Changed board and player to better work with the GUI
    
    You now start the application by running Monopoly, which creates the GUIs in the right order. By the time the BoardGUI is created it also created the Board class. I made a ScoreboardGUI but I'm not going to worry about it until we have some functionality going. Each GUI has it's own main so we can run it alone to test with JUnit.

    "The GUI Push"
    
    We now have a prepared GUI. It starts off with InitialGUI, which gives buttons to choose the number of players. This GUI calls the PlayerEntryGUI which takes in the player names and their icon choice. This GUI will then call BoardGUI, which instantiates the visible board. I have a few questions about the flow that the GUI's should take. The way I think it should flow is:
    
    Monopoly has the main
    which creates an InitialGUI and takes in the number of players
    which creates PlayerEntryGUI that now has the number of players and names and icons
    which creates BoardGUI that has everything necessary
    which creates the Board object(the controller)
    
    I'm not sure if this is the right flow, it's just how I see things flowing right now. Let me know if anyone has any other ideas.

    Found all of the token pictures. Cropped them to the correct size for the board. Also renamed all JPanels for easy reference, might have to change them to JPanels... Not sure yet

    UI has temporary panels for each square.
    
    Later on I will add a roll button and maybe a legend to show the players and how much money they have. Need to figure out the icons and how to place on certain squares.

    Fixed a typo in Square #13 that I noticed
    
    Probably just a copy paste error. #11 and #13 were named the same variables but had different actual names
