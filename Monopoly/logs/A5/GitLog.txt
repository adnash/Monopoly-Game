    PostTurn. Numbers->Numbers+Names.
    
    So PostTurn is a new class that is called as the handler for all post turn activities. It creates a new GUI with all the options for the post turn. Also changed the dropdown menus in the postturn to have names and numbers instead of just the numbers. This will make it a little easier (and cuz the TA said to)

    Took out seconds timer. Found issues with AI.
    
    When the AI rolls a double and land on a purchasable square it prompts the player to buy it, instead of the algorithm deciding to buy it

commit 3c8511247c4c7e21bc3c5bfa0b1396eb7e41d4bd
Author: Conor <conbrocox@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 16 22:14:51 2016 -0700

    Where I think we are at so far. Secret roll button. Input AI on start.
    
    You can now click the "GO" square at any time to move the current player to any square you want. The button is invisable but it is there.
    
    There is now a choice to make player AI or not when inputting them. The AI seems to work correctly so far. The scoreboard will append "AI " to the beginning of someone's name if they are AI.
    
    The Chance and Community Chest are barely functional. They don't handle squares correctly, don't have break; statements at the end of each case so multiple of them run at once, creates it's own jail by casting a square as jail instead of using the already made jail class.
    
    The secret roll button can be used so you guys can test your own stuff now to make sure it works. You should be able to just run the BoardGUI class and it will start a game with some defaults.
    
    Things I'm not sure of and to look into:
    	Alan
    When someone wins the game, the message displayed has their current balance instead of their total. It might be better if it says like "blah won with a combined total of $xxxx instead of just their balance. Not sure if you have already fixed this or not.
    	Dan
    Put break;'s after every case so they all don't run. Make sure you are accessing and casting squares in the right way.
    	Alex
    Maybe start a game from Monopoly and make everyone an AI and just keep rolling and see if it works how you think it should work.

    Scoreboard complete. Timer.
    
    I have completed the scoreboard I think. I added the timer so the player can see how much time is left. It currently counts every minute as a second and we will have to change that before we JAR it up. Also need to end the game when the timer is up. The update method in the GUI should be good to go. We can call it anywhere in board to update the GUI. Calling update in the BoardGUI calls the update in the ScoreboardGUI as well

    Refactored the GUI, started the scoreboard, deeds, organization.
    
    The BoardGUI class is now broken down into methods instead of literally one damn method. It's not entirely finished but I need to make progress on other things to know how I should continue to refactor. The ScoreboardGUI class is being built. I will eventually move some stuff from the BoardGUI to the scoreboard because the BoardGUI will only need to update player positions from now on, the scoreboard handles all balances, dice rolls, names, colors, and icons. We now have a .png of each deed on the board. Every real estate, railroad, and utility. I will put something on the RR and utilities to show who owns them. Then I will make a button for each ownable property and when clicked it will simply just display the deed card instead of having to make my own deed cards. I put all the logos in logos/ and all the deeds in deeds/.

    GUI is very close!
    
    Only thing needed is to print out what properties the player has at the start of each postTurn. This was semi-implemented in Trade by Dan, so thanks.
    
    Players can move around but the amount of buttons is annoying AF

    You now start the application by running Monopoly, which creates the GUIs in the right order. By the time the BoardGUI is created it also created the Board class. I made a ScoreboardGUI but I'm not going to worry about it until we have some functionality going. Each GUI has it's own main so we can run it alone to test with JUnit.

    "The GUI Push"
    
    We now have a prepared GUI. It starts off with InitialGUI, which gives buttons to choose the number of players. This GUI calls the PlayerEntryGUI which takes in the player names and their icon choice. This GUI will then call BoardGUI, which instantiates the visible board. I have a few questions about the flow that the GUI's should take. The way I think it should flow is:
    
    Monopoly has the main
    which creates an InitialGUI and takes in the number of players
    which creates PlayerEntryGUI that now has the number of players and names and icons
    which creates BoardGUI that has everything necessary
    which creates the Board object(the controller)
    
    I'm not sure if this is the right flow, it's just how I see things flowing right now. Let me know if anyone has any other ideas.
